# Python Intro
Introductory Class for Python (for Grand Circus Hacker Fellows)

These are just some examples for the Grand Circus Hacker Fellows crash course on Python. Slides for the class are [here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1BJnKhmqsnpyZM0SJkb5COw1D4l4uJoIMG8wYQ6SYifk/edit?usp=sharing).

Comments/Critiques on either the slides or the examples are completely welcome! Feel free to either message me on Slack or Github, or just make a pull request.

I plan on adding the slides and examples for the second half of this class... as soon as I actually make those slides and examples.
